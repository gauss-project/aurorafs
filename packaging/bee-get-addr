Check https://docs.ethswarm.org/ for more info.

Fix the configuration and try again.

Please make sure there is sufficient ETH and BZZ available on the node's Ethereum address: $ETH_ADDRESS.

You can get both Goerli ETH and Goerli BZZ via the Bzzaar at https://bzz.ethswarm.org/?transaction=buy&amount=10&slippage=30&receiver=0x$ETH_ADDRESS

Or you can join us on Discord (at https://discord.gg/ykCupZMuww) and ask our bot for a sprinkle in the #faucet-request channel.

Once the node's wallet has received the funds it will begin joining the Swarm network.
